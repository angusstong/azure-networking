## Azure VNet limits

There are certain limits around the number of Azure resources you can deploy. Most Azure networking limits are at the maximum values. However, you can [increase certain networking limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/networking-quota-requests) as specified on the [VNet limits page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#networking-limits). 

The maximum number of virtual network per region per subscription is 1000.
